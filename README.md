# Newsletter Summary AI
I have lots of newsletters and I just read the headlines anyways. This takes emails from "newsletter" inbox in the last 24h, summarizes the headlines, and conslidates them into one email. 

Could deploy this with a cronjob or lambda. The gmail tokens need to be refreshed manually since this isn't an authorized Google App.
